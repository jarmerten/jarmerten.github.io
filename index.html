				<h3>Early Years</h3>
					<p>Quarterback Brett Favre was born Brett Lorenzo Favre in Gulfport, Mississippi, on October 10, 1969. The second of four boys, Favre grew up in the wilds of bayou country, hunting and fishing with his three brothers.
			<br><br>
					In school, Favre, like his siblings, showed a passion and talent for baseball and football. Initially, at least, he seemed to be a better baseball player, as Favre took a spot in the starting rotation for Hancock North Central in the eighth grade.
			<br><br>
					But as the son of a tough-nosed football coach, Favre demonstrated a gift in his other sport as well. Big and strong, Favre, who was coached by his father in high school, played quarterback throughout his years at Hancock North Central. But his talent drew little notice or praise from college scouts. When it came time to pick a school, Favre chose the University of Southern Mississippi, in large part because it was the only college to offer him a scholarship.
			<br><br>
					As a college player, Favre packed a toughness his teammates easily admired, with a propensity for late-game heroics. He also set several school records, and in the 1991 NFL draft, the Atlanta Falcons chose the young QB with the 33rd overall selection.</p>
